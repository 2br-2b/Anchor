# Anchor

The infinite scroll. It's dangerously easy to scroll mindlessly for hours, especially when it comes to social media.
 
So what if we playfully visualised infinite scrolling as a deep sea dive, to help people experience their scrolling habit more tangibly?
 
Anchor is a simple Chrome extension which plays on this feeling of sinking. The further down you scroll, the deeper you dive â€” and you can watch as your screen slowly turns a dark blue, a little fish swims across your screen, and finally, you hit a (literal) rock bottom.
 
We're thinking this could be easily adapted and expanded (by you!) into a whole series of scrolling experiments. Think cave exploring, parachuting, digging to the center of the Earth... All our code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/benjchan/Anchor) for you to play with and evolve.
