# Anchor

The infinite scroll. It's dangerously easy to scroll mindlessly for hours, especially when it comes to social media.
 
So what if we playfully visualized infinite scrolling as a deep sea dive, to help people experience their scrolling habit more tangibly?
 
Anchor is a simple Chromium extension (meaning it works on Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, Google Chrome, and more!) which plays on this feeling of sinking. The further down you scroll, the deeper you dive â€” and you can watch as your screen slowly turns a dark blue, a little fish swims across your screen, and finally, you hit a (literal) rock bottom.

Feel free to suggest any changes or open any issues for ideas you want implemented!

## Credits
 
I'm expanding [the original project](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/anchor) by [Brendan Browne-Adams](https://www.brendanbrownedesigns.com/), [Lahari Goswami](https://laharigoswami.cargo.site), [Miki Chiu](https://www.mikichiu.com), [Tayo Kopfer](https://tayo.co.za), and [Twomuch Studio](https://twomuch.studio) to add additional functionality. Part of the beauty of the original extension is its simplicity, and I will try to maintain it as much as I can.
